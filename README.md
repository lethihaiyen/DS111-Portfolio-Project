# DS111-Portfolio-Project
In this project, I will handle the movie ratings data and customer's subjective-based questions to find a connection between their personalities and their liking to each movies. This will help me make better movie recommendations for each users. 
The cover story is that I'm working for a major entertainment corporation that is trying to get a better handle on both what makes a good movie as well as a better understanding of the viewers.
